### Before you re-install

First, go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?

### Setting up your Mac

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedroabreu/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:pedroabreu/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

4. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    ~/.dotfiles/fresh.sh
    ```

5. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> ðŸ’¡ You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.

## Your Own Dotfiles

**Please note that the instructions below assume you already have set up Oh My Zsh so make sure to first [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started) before you continue.**

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://caskroom.github.io/search) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`path.zsh`](./path.zsh) file. These files get loaded in because the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` setting points to the `.dotfiles` directory. You can adjust the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file to your liking to tweak your Oh My Zsh setup. More info about how to customize Oh My Zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization).

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!
